    "#### <u>Background\n",
    "Phosphorus (P) loss from agricultural production is a significant contributor to surface water contamination. Excessive inputs of P to surface waters can lead to eutrophication, potentially causing an increase in algal and aquatic plant growth (Correll, 1998; Carpenter et al., 1998). Eutrophication, and associated harmful algal blooms, are conservatively estimated to cost the United Statesâ€™ economy 2.4-4.6 billion dollars a year and it has been estimated that up to 70% of all P that reaches surface waters is linked to a nonpoint agricultural source (Havlin et al., 2005; Dodds et al., 2009). The linkage between nonpoint agricultural P pollution and the degradation of surface water quality has created a need for new agricultural best management practices (BMP) to reduce P loss. To do this, a multiyear, large-scale, trial was run to examine the impacts of cover-crops and phosphorus fertilizer placement on P loss in surface runoff from natural precipitation events. \n",

    "#### <u>Objective\n",
    "As part of this research project, precipitation data was recorded, at one-minute intervals, from five rain gauges located across the research site. Over the course of this project (5 years), this has generated a massive amount of data. This project aims to develop a program which enables the user to enter at start and end time of a precipitation event and be given a data set containing one-minute interval precipitation data plus precipitation summary statistics (e.g. 24, 48, and 72 hour rainfall and annual cumulative precipitation) for that precipitaiton event.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### <u>Outcomes\n",
    "This project will create a .csv file which contains one-minute precipitation data for a given precipitation event. In addition, this code will also provide a set of summary statistics for the given precipitation event. \n",
